# Predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit

#### Predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. 

## Project Description
creating tools that use our operational data to help the business achieve its goals.
For this project, the objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (indicated by the variable "y" as "yes" or "no").

Your task is to build a predictive model that determines the likelihood of a client subscribing to a term deposit based on the features provided in the dataset.

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
